====== Born to the Saddle ======
Created Saturday 03 August 2019

Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. 
You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling offyour mount. 
If you fall offyour mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.
Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than halfyour speed.
