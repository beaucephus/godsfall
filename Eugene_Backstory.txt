Eugene was born into a small village of kobolds and humans, an unlikely pair.
He and his kobold brothers and sisters built, cleaned, attended,
and otherwise did the bidding of their human keepers.
Eugene was a slave.

As Eugene matured, he became aware of the terms of his people's bondage.
In a glimpse of clarity and curiosity,
he found a magical artifact in Albrek's, his human master's, possession.
It was a single dragon's tooth which Albrek used to control the kobold's hearts and minds.

One fateful night Eugene stole the dragon's tooth,
breaking the spell on his people.
The newly enlightened kobolds mutinied over their human slavers.
They burned fields of grain, looted homes, and tore at their slavers' flesh.

Eugene, fearful, did not take part in the mutiny.
He took the tooth and fled amidst the turmoil,
fearful of the rage exhibited by his kin,
fearful of retribution from his human slavers,
fearful...

Eugene now travels the multiverse with his companion, Bowtie.
He still carries the dragon's tooth and always keeps on the move,
fearful of staying in any one place too long.
Otherwise Albrek might find him.
